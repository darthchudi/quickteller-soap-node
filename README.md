# Quickteller Soap Node

This library aims to provide a simple interface for consuming Quickteller's SOAP API.
It focuses mainly on providing abstractions around the _bill payment_ methods in the Quickteller SOAP API, mainly because that's what inspired the creation of the library. Feel free to fork it and add any extra methods you might need. Please make sure you follow the existing convention(s) found in the code.
